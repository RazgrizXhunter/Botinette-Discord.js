# Botinette
### A Discord bot inspired by the needs of MarinetteNyan's Discord Server.

This is a multifaceted bot buit by the needs of [MarinetteNyan](https://www.twitch.tv/marinettenyan)'s [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pxCfCmdSVs), so it's shape and form isn't really defined. The idea of having this repo is to be able to help other people build their bots and use this one as an example and be transparent with what the bot does. Since the community of said VStreamer is spanish-speaking, the commands and also the responses are set in spanish.

## Commands

 - **/setup:** This command creates a new channel called "*botinette-horarios*" in which the users can react with their country flag, so the bot know what time zones to add to the **/hora** comamnd.
 - **/hora *hour:minutes*:** This command transforms the given time from Spain-Madrid to the time zones set in *botinette-horarios*. 
 - **/play *YouTube link*:** Plays the given YouTube video. *(Disabled in production due to the limitations of the server running the bot)*

## Planned Updates

 - [ ] Add full date to the time zones, so it can display the day of the event. *(considering not all time zones are in the same day at once)*
 - [ ] Add multiple countries to the **/hora** command, so it can even convert the time zones of the users. *As of now, it is intended only to check time in Spain.*
